# Overview

## The Challenge

The task is to display the repositories and allow the user to filter through the repositories. Use
the official GitHub API to fetch and display repositories per user.

Github API Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/rest

# My process

## Built With

- This project is built on Angular 11.
- I have used basic bootstrap css (CDN Link) to make web page responsive and look good.
- Also used Github API to access user detail information and fetch user repositories.

## Coding Standards

- Local variables uses camel case lettering whereas constant variable are formed using capital letters only and model variables are created using an underscore symbol between words.
- Used standard proper indentation guidelines.
- Have given necessary comments in the code.
- Used exception handling to show appropriate message if data is not fetched from an API.
- Have divided the component into small chunks which gives us leverage to reuse the component.
- Component of the app are named in such a way that you can easily recognise for what and which purpose the component is used for.
